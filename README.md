https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/auto-reload.50888/

## Requirements

First make sure you have a spigot server, running minecraft 1.12 or greater. A guide to install this can be found [here](https://www.spigotmc.org/wiki/spigot-installation/)

Once you complete that make sure you also have [ServerUtils](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/serverutils-bungeecord-spigot-manage-plugins-in-game-plugman-alternative-more.79599/) installed, which you can do by downloading the latest plugman jar and moving it into your servers plugin folder.

### Installing

Download the latest version of [Auto Reload](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/auto-reload.50888/) from spigot, then put it in your servers plugins folder (usually called /plugins)
That's it! Just restart your server using /stop and you're done!
